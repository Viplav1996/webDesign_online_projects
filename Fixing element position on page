Applied Visual Design: Lock an Element to its Parent with Absolute PositioningPassed
The next option for the CSS position property is absolute, which locks the element in place relative to its parent container.
Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it.
The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust the position.

One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor.
If you forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using position: relative;),
the browser will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.








<style>
  #searchbar {
    position: absolute;
    right:50px;
    top:50px;
  }
  section {
    position: relative;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <section>
    <form id="searchbar">
      <label for="search">Search:</label>
      <input type="search" id="search" name="search">
      <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Go!">
    </form>
  </section>
</body>







The next layout scheme that CSS offers is the fixed position, which is a type of absolute positioning that locks an element relative to the browser window. 
Similar to absolute positioning, it's used with the CSS offset properties and also removes the element from the normal flow of the document.
Other items no longer "realize" where it is positioned, which may require some layout adjustments elsewhere.

One key difference between the fixed and absolute positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move when the user scrolls.

The navigation bar in the code is labeled with an id of navbar. Change its position to fixed,
and offset it 0 pixels from the top and 0 pixels from the left. After you have added the code, scroll the preview window to see how the navigation stays in place.



<style>
  body {
    min-height: 150vh;
  }
  #navbar {
    position:fixed;
    top:0px;
    left:0px;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: #767676;
  }
  nav ul {
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 5px 0px 5px 30px;
  }
  nav li {
    display: inline;
    margin-right: 20px;
  }
  a {
    text-decoration: none;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <nav id="navbar">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <p>I shift up when the #navbar is fixed to the browser window.</p>
</body>
