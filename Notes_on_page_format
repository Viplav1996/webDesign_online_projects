Applied Visual Design: Change the Position of Overlapping Elements with the z-index PropertyPassed
When elements are positioned to overlap (i.e. using position: absolute | relative | fixed | sticky), 
the element coming later in the HTML markup will, by default, appear on the top of the other elements. 
However, the z-index property can specify the order of how elements are stacked on top of one another. 
It must be an integer (i.e. a whole number and not a decimal), and higher values for the z-index property
of an element move it higher in the stack than those with lower values.



Applied Visual Design: Center an Element Horizontally Using the margin PropertyPassed
Another positioning technique is to center a block element horizontally. One way to do this is to set its margin to a value of auto.

This method works for images, too. Images are inline elements by default, but can be changed to block elements when you set the display property to block.
